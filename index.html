<h1>My Favorite Pet </h1>
<p>My favorite pet is a dog, my pet dog name is Simon, 
he is now 8 months old. He is vey polite and a lovable dog, he also like to play.
He is my bestfriend and even my brother.
I cannot find the words to explain how
much having a dog in my life means to me,
but i do know that without my dog my world
would be so much more dark and empty.</p>
